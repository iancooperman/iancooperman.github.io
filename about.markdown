Hi, I'm Ian Cooperman, an aspiring software engineer with a B.S. in computer science and a relentless drive to solve complex problems. With a background in IT and a deep understanding of various programming languages, I thrive in creating efficient and innovative solutions.

My journey in the tech world began with a fascination for video games, which evolved into a love for coding and developing software that pushes the boundaries of technology. I'm particularly interested in machine learning and its potential to create immersive experiences, akin to a real-life holodeck.

In my previous role with LAUSD, I tackled numerous technical challenges, streamlined processes, and improved the overall user experience. Now, I'm seeking new opportunities to leverage my skills in a collaborative and dynamic environment that values creativity and integrity.

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new cuisines, especially Indian food, and delving into thought-provoking topics about existence and consciousness. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
